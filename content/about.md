## Who am I


I'm Lucas, a Software Engineer with extensive expertise in backend development, a technology enthusiast currently delving into the field of Artificial Intelligence, with a focus on Deep Learning and Machine Learning. My goal is to create intelligent and innovative solutions for the market.

## My Trajectory
My journey in the tech world began in technical support, working with computers and networks. I then transitioned to customer support, assisting clients in using systems provided by the companies I worked for. During this time, I gained valuable experience in problem-solving and developing effective solutions. It was in this role that I began building skills in database management, API integration development, and data collection automation using SQL scripts.

This experience led me to software development, where I became a Systems Analyst. In this role, I worked on Python-based automation, developed new system features in PHP, maintained and structured large databases, managed cloud environments on AWS, and contributed to major projects within the company.

* **Design and Editing**: Ability to create interfaces and visual content using Figma, UI/UX, Adobe XD, Photoshop, Premiere, among others.
* **SoftSkills**: Ease of working in a group, ease of communication, time management, empathy and flexibility.
